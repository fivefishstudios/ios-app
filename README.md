- our pods folder is commited which is recommended for easy builds ([http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-ignore-the-pods-directory-in-source-control](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-ignore-the-pods-directory-in-source-control))

- our models, viewcontrollers and views are **grouped within XCode** which is recommended pattern ([http://vocaro.com/trevor/blog/2012/10/21/xcode-groups-vs-folder-references/](http://vocaro.com/trevor/blog/2012/10/21/xcode-groups-vs-folder-references/)), so for development purposes please use XCode
